<p class="message">
  Hey there! Thanks for checking out my blog. If you want to discuss some of the things included here, or communicate with me for any other reason, don't hesitate to do so. ☺️
</p>

I am a McGill software engineering student. I am currently learning machine learning, HDLs, x86 assembly and how to write compilers, Coq (and Mandarin Chinese).

I am interested in artificial intelligence, programming languages (type systems, memory management, etc.), algorithms, game theory and mathematics in general, philosophy, physics, chess & poker.

I also like to spend time listening to music, reading novels and Hacker News, running, swimming, or climbing.

If you like music too, you can find my main playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kqdYN4QThlbw1iiXvn0X2?si=M6bYh_HZRL65jfnpa696Yg).
