## This website is a blog, a digital playground and a wiki.

It uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and GitHub Pages to generate a static site and publish it each time I push to [this repository](https://github.com/Gadiguibou/gadiguibou.github.io).

Most of the content is therefore in markdown and gets added to a default HTML layout automatically.
