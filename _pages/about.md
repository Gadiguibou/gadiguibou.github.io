# About Me

I'm a McGill software engineering student who's curious about most things that surround him. I'm currently learning the following: machine learning, HDLs, x86 assembly, how to write compilers, Coq, and Mandarin Chinese.

I'm interested in artificial intelligence, programming languages (type systems, memory management, etc.), algorithms, game theory and mathematics in general, philosophy, physics, chess and poker.

I also like to spend time listening to music, reading novels and Hacker News, running, swimming, or climbing.

If you like music too, you can find my main playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kqdYN4QThlbw1iiXvn0X2?si=M6bYh_HZRL65jfnpa696Yg).

I mostly listen to it in reverse order of date added since this is what reflects my current tastes in music the most.

Happy listening!
