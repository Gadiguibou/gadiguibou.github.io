title: Music To Help Soothe Lonely Hearts
---

Another week of 2020 has gone by and things have been, well, strange. I haven't been able to tell whether we're headed somewhere much worse or much better.

As a new semester begins, I might not have as much time to listen to music as I did these past weeks. As such, this may be my most prolific week of the next two to three months (with regards to how much music I listen to at least).

## 2021 Weekly Playlist - Week 1

I'll start with what the song that moved me the most.

[anything by Adrianne Lenker](https://open.spotify.com/track/4PwWESSlTwzvw9B7bmtTLS?si=4BlHUh-vQmy91y3zNfGOeg)

The honesty and sensitivity in Adrianne Lenker's voice is unsettling. It's hard not to relate to the beautiful lyrics either as she sings:

> And I don’t wanna talk about anything
I don’t wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyеs looking
I don’t wanna talk about anyone
I don’t wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you’rе driving
Lay in your lap when I’m crying

Next up, a classic rock ballad.

[Lover, You Should've Come Over by Jeff Buckley](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Jv7kjGkhY2fT4yuBF3aTz?si=uAA4GzjcRC2GBL_Fyz4smA)

We change repertoire with a group that is completely new to me: "Tank and The Bangas".

[Ants by Tank and The Bangas](https://open.spotify.com/track/0r71bOApGbwrGrl2Tn0AWw?si=1zFMrPjAR9iVtMq1YPEMMA)

[November Has Come by Gorillaz](https://open.spotify.com/track/6lrDckuosGpwEHtm1hHBcf?si=kj9dYKakSb-Jw5Djsuqxlg)

This song had always been one of my favorite off Gorillaz's Demon Days, but I never realized it was DOOM rapping these verses. In homage to the illest villain.

[Vaudeville Villain by Viktor Vaughn](https://open.spotify.com/track/6rkV9hz91Rr5iHnMRPZdEQ?si=bEcxlg7kTZmV24craqnXkg)

Another DOOM song I rediscovered recently.

[Bittersweet - Full Length by Lianne La Havas](https://open.spotify.com/track/4uawMXx8VZ7WMrjAVOaCMe?si=WE2GpqDER5iJzHO7QnDicQ)

As promised, a little bit more of Lianne La Havas.

To end this post on a good note, I'd like to share this treasure of a song. No matter how many times I've listened to it, it still sends chills down my spine.

[The Sun Is In Your Eyes - Voice Memo by Jacob Collier](https://open.spotify.com/track/6BzQnbYMiASXdwTerVH3zy?si=KepsGSf5SF6VVKkVaNvB0A)
