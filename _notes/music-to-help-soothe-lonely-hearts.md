Another week of 2020 has gone by and things have been, well, strange. I haven't been able to tell whether we're headed somewhere much worse or much better.

As a new semester begins, I might not have as much time to listen to music as I did these past weeks. As such, this may be my most prolific week of the next two to three months (with regards to how much music I listen to at least).

## 2021 Weekly Playlist - Week 1

This is probably the song that moved me the most this week.

[anything by Adrianne Lenker](https://open.spotify.com/track/4PwWESSlTwzvw9B7bmtTLS?si=4BlHUh-vQmy91y3zNfGOeg)

The sensitivity in Adrianne Lenker's voice is unsettling. The lyrics also contribute to the beauty of the song:

> And I don’t wanna talk about anything\\
> I don’t wanna talk about anything\\
> I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again\\
> Wanna witness your eyеs looking\\
> I don’t wanna talk about anyone\\
> I don’t wanna talk about anyone\\
> I wanna sleep in your car while you’rе driving\\
> Lay in your lap when I’m crying

[Lover, You Should've Come Over by Jeff Buckley](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Jv7kjGkhY2fT4yuBF3aTz?si=uAA4GzjcRC2GBL_Fyz4smA)

We change repertoire with a group that was completely new to me: "Tank and The Bangas".

[Ants by Tank and The Bangas](https://open.spotify.com/track/0r71bOApGbwrGrl2Tn0AWw?si=1zFMrPjAR9iVtMq1YPEMMA)

[November Has Come by Gorillaz](https://open.spotify.com/track/6lrDckuosGpwEHtm1hHBcf?si=kj9dYKakSb-Jw5Djsuqxlg)

This song had always been one of my favorite off Gorillaz's Demon Days, but I never realized it was DOOM rapping these verses. In homage to the illest villain.

[Vaudeville Villain by Viktor Vaughn](https://open.spotify.com/track/6rkV9hz91Rr5iHnMRPZdEQ?si=bEcxlg7kTZmV24craqnXkg)

Another DOOM song I rediscovered recently.

 No matter how many times I've listened to this one, it still sends chills down my spine.
